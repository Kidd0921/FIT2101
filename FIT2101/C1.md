# Our Process Model

Our process model follows scrum as closely as possible however, there will be changes such as: 

*   Due to the pandemic, having face-to-face conversations would not be possible, hence our only substitute for this is zoom meetings. This is effective as setting up meetings can be flexible, reducing the risk of having members not being able to meet.

*   Another difference is that responsibilities given to each role can overlap with other roles. For example, the product owner and scrum master will also handle the coding aspect of the project compared to scrum where each role has distinct responsibilities. The reason for this is that as students, we would want to experience how each role operates rather than having one person take on the same role for the rest of the project. This is feasible as each member can cover for each other’s weaknesses easily.

*   As students, we would be handling more than one assignment and we would most likely not work on the same project everyday hence, having daily scrums would not be very efficient. Our solution would be to have weekly meetings but with the same agenda as daily scrums. This would reduce the number of unnecessary meetings which could hold back on our team's progress on their own assignments.


# Task Tracking
For all the assignments done with this group, we have decided to use a combination of git, Google Drive and also Trello in order to track the work and progress of each team member. The reason we decided to track work in this way is because we feel that it might be hard to track using just Git alone since a large number of tasks in the assignment require writing documents instead of just coding. Google Drive allows us to check for work done (such as which part was typed by which member etc.), Git allows us to track any programming code written and last but not least Trello helps to track the overall progress towards completing the project. This allows us to be much more flexible and would also allow the marker to gain a clearer insight towards the work done by each of the members within the group.

# Time Tracking
1. When do we have our meeting?
* We normally have a meeting every time we complete a portion of the assignment just to ensure everyone is on the same page.

| Meeting       | Date          | Time		|
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| First		| 20/8		| 15:00		|
| Second	| 23/8		| 20:00		|
| Third		| 25/8		| 20:30		|
| Final		| 26/8		| 20:30		|

2. Due date for each of our task
* We have specified and recorded it in Trello. The invitation link is at below.
3. Task tracking for individual tasks assigned
* All of us upload our progress, allowing everyone of the members to have an inspection of the current progress for each other.

# Task Allocating
The assignment contains three main parts, which are Project Planning, Analysis of Alternatives and Risk Register. During the first meeting, all of us agreed to split task 1, completing it with pairs and finish task 2 with group discussion. However, there was a minor conflict amongst the team members when deciding how to delegate the work for task 2. Fortunately, after finishing analyzing task 2 and task 3 in detail, all of us came to the consensus that both the tasks need to be done with the whole group in order to have an easier discussion and a better result. Many points need to be agreed upon before writing down so it would be easier to do it during a meeting where all team members are present and are able to give their opinion in order to ensure that the answer written is representative of the whole team’s idea. Thus, we have decided to focus on Task 1 first and made a due date for it (23/8). We split it into 3 parts, (Task 1 Part 1: Dylan Tan / Kin Jian Xin, Task 1 Part 2: Darren Yee, Ng Yi Jie , Task 1 Part 3: Hoh Zheng Jie, Peter Lee ) each of them was chosen voluntarily by 3 pairs of our members. 

Within 4 days, we all have finished our tasks given on time. We have checked the results done by each other in order to ensure the correctness and completeness. Each of the pairs had a short speech on the work and everything was going fine. After that, we proceeded to our second meeting which was to plan the deliverables 2 and 3. We decided to use Flask which is a type of web based application in order to develop our application. We made this decision due to the different backgrounds of our team (some are more fluent in Python and Java whereas the others are more comfortable with HTML and Javascript). We then proceed to task 3, which is about risk register. Surprisingly, everything worked out fine including the discussion, figuration and decision. We finished it relatively quickly and thus we have successfully built up the foundation of our assignment.For the last meeting, we make the last check of our work and finalise the compilation of our project and we are done with the assignment.

# Deliverable 2: Analysis of Alternatives

1. Programming language 
In this section, our team will evaluate the alternatives that the team has gathered from the web (i.e. Trend of Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework), as well as from our technical experience. 

* The primary two alternatives we will be considering are Flask (i.e. Python) and Java.
Java is a pure object-oriented programming (OOP) language while python, unlike Java having a specific ‘niche’, is a very versatile platform, which also means Python allows programmers to create OOP easily. However, we will be evaluating further (i.e. Their pros and cons) before making a final decision on which programming language to use.

| Pros of using Python (MVC framework context) | Cons of using Python (MVC framework context) |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
|<ul><li>Highly readable and high learnability.</li><li> Python itself has a variety of packages that would be very beneficial. For example, creating graphs can be performed easily with the Matplot library.</li><li> Python also has libraries that sync in with the project requirements (i.e. Pandas, used to analyze data such as staffs’ login details) </li><li> High interactivity with a range of languages, making it a safe-proof property of our project (i.e. Reducing the chance of us) </li></ul> | <ul><li>Speed limitations. To elaborate on this, an interpreter performs slower than a compiler when the program gets bigger and complex, which will be a possible obstacle when the project requirements get more complicated and tedious. </li><li> Although Python is known for its flexibility of its data types. It is still not ideal for memory-intensive tasks. </li></ul>| 


|   Pros of using Java (MVC framework context) |   Cons of using Java (MVC framework context) |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
|<ul><li> High maintainability compared to Python. This is because Java is a pure OOP language, making its extensibility ability greater. </li><li> Since Java is an OOP language, its framework would be beneficial to the idea of MVC framework (i.e. Separating a software into three compartments: Model, Control and View, is easier and more neat with Java) </li><li> Easier to debug a complex software compared to Python </li></ul>|<ul><li> A more difficult language to wield. </li><li> Unlike Python having a variety of packages, it would very likely need a lot of other languages to perform the specifications given (i.e. Graphing). </li><li> Lower interactivity with other languages than Python. </li></ul>|


|Pros of using JavaScript (MVC framework context)|Cons of using JavaScript (MVC framework context)|
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|<ul><li> Able to loadout with HTML, enable web view </li><li> JavaScript can almost build all of the features if the programmer is familiar enough to handle it </li></ul>|<ul><li> Since the Javascript is viewable to the user, it might weaken the client-side security </li><li> It might be time-consuming if the developer did not experience much with it since it required more skill to code. </li></ul>|


|Pros of using HTML and CSS (MVC framework context)|Cons of using HTML and CSS (MVC framework context)|
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
|<ul><li> Low-barrier entry, programmers do not need to have a bigger knowledge in programming </li><li> Complete UI, HTML and CSS frameworks can create a seamless user experience with buttons, navigation, typography, behaviour(scripts) and various other assets </li><li> Stability, they are well tested on various devices and browsers by a huge group of people </li></ul>|<ul><li> Learning, it takes time to learn their syntax in order to be able to work with them </li><li> Similarity, HTML and CSS websites may look similar to the other ones out there </li><li> Dependence, we are not the author of the framework, we are forced to accept all of the author’s modifications to the framework </li></ul>|


|Pros of using SQL for Database (MVC framework context)|Cons of using SQL for Database (MVC framework context)|
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
|<ul><li> Easy to use </li><li> Wisely used for Business Intelligence </li><li> Data manipulation and data testing can be easily done through SQL </li><li> SQL provides a faster querying process without the need to write a huge number of lines of code </li></ul>|<ul><li> SQL has a difficult interface that makes some users uncomfortable </li><li> Some versions of the SQL database are costly </li><li> May only have partial control over the database due to hidden business rules </li></ul>|



2. Platform/architecture : Web application

* After much deliberation, the platform that we ultimately ended up with is to create a web application. This option best satisfies the requirements given by the client during our meetings as it was stated that the client wishes to use the application on her laptop while also making it easily accessible for other users. Web applications can be opened on both mobile and computer browsers which shows just how versatile
it is. In fact, our choice was also partially affected by the fact that it allows us to utilize our different skill - sets properly (some of us are from Computer Science so we are more comfortable with Python whereas the others are from Software Engineering so they are more comfortable with Javascript and HTML etc.). In order to achieve this, we decided to utilize the Flask API which allows us to implement the application using Python and JavaScript in tandem. 

3. Other options considered

    Aside from creating a web application, our group also came up with other architecture choices initially such as a standalone application or a mobile application.
* A standalone application has multiple advantages over a web application such that it does not entirely rely on an active web server to be functional but instead performs computations locally. Moreover, a standalone application does not require any form of server hosting, once it is installed into a computer, the application will be available without any cost. Despite its multiple advantages, the option is not feasible as our group has limited knowledge on creating a working standalone application, considering the quality of our product, we have decided to discard the option.
* On the other hand, a mobile application would also be a great choice as a mobile application is easily accessible by the population since everyone nowadays has a phone. But considering a web application can also be opened from a phone, which inherits most of the advantages of a mobile application. Furthermore, our client mentioned that the main device they frequently use would be desktop and laptop, thus making the choice of creating a mobile application unsuitable for this situation.

4. Criteria for selection 

    When choosing what programming language to use and on what platform to use, our team has three main criterias:
* What language each team member is familiar with
* What are the main devices used by our client
* The requirements from our client

    During our interview with our client, we found out that our client mainly uses her laptop and desktop in her office. We were asked and required to develop an application which is able to input different datasets and get different results from it. We need to ensure that our application can interpret the current fundamental situation and it is user friendly to the general public. With this, we were left with two options as our platform, either a standalone application or a web based application. In the end, we chose a web based application because we do not have the knowledge to create a standalone application and some of us had some experience with creating a web application. For our programming language choice, since most of us are very familiar with python, we decided to use it for our back-end and use HTML, JavaScript and CSS as our front-end. Flask, a Python based web application with some HTML and Javascript not only satisfies the requirement of the client (Data Analysis), it also helps us to figure out a middle ground between the different skill sets of our team members.
